## Acknowledgements

The motivation for this project is the amazing <a href='https://www.covid19india.org' target='_blank'>
 covid19india.org</a>, a volunteer-run effort that compiled essential COVID data from the early days of the
pandemic up until October, 2021. Their herculean efforts made an enormous difference,
and are the foundation for this site.  

The volunteers at covid19india.org have retired, but have also
generously allowed us to fork their website and pipeline code. This is
our attempt to carry forward their legacy, but there is no official
connection or endorsement.

<a href='https://www.datakind.org/chapters/datakind-blr'
target='_blank'>DataKind Bangalore</a> is leading this
effort, coordinating many dedicated volunteers, with additional support from <a
href='https://www.devdatalab.org' target='_blank'>Development Data Lab</a>.
